<article style="color:black;"> Book is a medium for recording information in the form of writing or images, typically composed of many pages (made of papyrus, parchment, vellum, or paper) bound together and protected by a cover.[1] The technical term for this physical arrangement is codex (plural, codices). In the history of hand-held physical supports for extended written compositions or records, the codex replaces its predecessor, the scroll. A single sheet in a codex is a leaf and each side of a leaf is a page.

    As an intellectual object, a book is prototypically a composition of such great length that it takes a considerable investment of time to compose and still considered as an investment of time to read. In a restricted sense, a book is a self-sufficient section or part of a longer composition, a usage reflecting that, in antiquity, long works had to be written on several scrolls and each scroll had to be identified by the book it contained. Each part of Aristotle's Physics is called a book. In an unrestricted sense, a book is the compositional whole of which such sections, whether called books or chapters or parts, are parts.
    
    The intellectual content in a physical book need not be a composition, nor even be called a book. Books can consist only of drawings, engravings or photographs, crossword puzzles or cut-out dolls. In a physical book, the pages can be left blank or can feature an abstract set of lines to support entries, such as in an account book, an appointment book, an autograph book, a notebook, a diary or a sketchbook. Some physical books are made with pages thick and sturdy enough to support other physical objects, like a scrapbook or photograph album. Books may be distributed in electronic form as ebooks and other formats.
    
    Although in ordinary academic parlance a monograph is understood to be a specialist academic work, rather than a reference work on a scholarly subject, in library and information science monograph denotes more broadly any non-serial publication complete in one volume (book) or a finite number of volumes (even a novel like Proust's seven-volume In Search of Lost Time), in contrast to serial publications like a magazine, journal or newspaper. An avid reader or collector of books is a bibliophile or colloquially, "bookworm". Books are traded at both regular stores and specialized bookstores, and people can read borrowed books, often for free, at libraries. Google has estimated that by 2010, approximately 130,000,000 titles had been published.[2]
    
    In some wealthier nations, the sale of printed books has decreased because of the increased usage of ebooks.[3] Although in most countries printed books continue to outsell their digital counterparts due to many people still preferring to read in a traditional way.[4][5][6] The 21st century has also seen a rapid rise in the popularity of audiobooks, which are recordings of books being read aloud.[7]
    Etymology
    The word book comes from Old English bōc, which in turn comes from the Germanic root *bōk-, cognate to 'beech'.[8] In Slavic languages like Russian, Bulgarian, Macedonian буква bukva—'letter' is cognate with 'beech'. In Russian, Serbian and Macedonian, the word букварь (bukvar') or буквар (bukvar) refers to a primary school textbook that helps young children master the techniques of reading and writing. It is thus conjectured that the earliest Indo-European writings may have been carved on beech wood.[9] The Latin word codex, meaning a book in the modern sense (bound and with separate leaves), originally meant 'block of wood'.[10]</article>

History
<article style="color:black;"> History of books dates back to ancient times when humans first started recording information in writing. The earliest known form of written communication was cuneiform script, which was used by the Sumerians in ancient Mesopotamia around 3500 BCE. These inscriptions were made on clay tablets using a wedge-shaped stylus.

The ancient Egyptians also developed a form of writing around 3200 BCE using hieroglyphics, which were inscribed on papyrus scrolls. Papyrus was made by slicing the stems of the papyrus plant into thin strips and then placing them in layers that were pressed together and dried.

In China, paper was invented by Cai Lun in the Han dynasty around 105 CE. This innovation revolutionized the way books were produced, making them more affordable and widely available. Chinese books were traditionally made from woodblock prints, where each page was carved onto a wooden block, inked, and then printed onto paper.

The printing press, invented by Johannes Gutenberg in the 15th century, was a major milestone in the history of books. It allowed books to be produced more quickly and cheaply than ever before, making them more widely available to the general population. Gutenberg's invention used movable type, where individual letters and symbols could be arranged and rearranged to create text on a page.

In the 19th century, the industrial revolution brought about further advances in book production. The development of new printing presses, such as the rotary press and the linotype machine, made it possible to produce books more quickly and efficiently than ever before.

The 20th century saw the rise of electronic books, or e-books, which are digital versions of printed books that can be read on electronic devices such as computers, tablets, and e-readers. E-books have become increasingly popular in recent years, and many publishers now offer their titles in both print and digital formats.

Overall, the history of books has been a long and fascinating one, shaped by technological advances and cultural developments over thousands of years. Despite the rise of digital media, books continue to play an important role in education, entertainment, and culture.
During the Middle Ages, books were mostly produced by monks in monasteries, who would painstakingly copy texts by hand onto parchment or vellum. Illuminated manuscripts, which were decorated with ornate illustrations and embellishments, were particularly popular among the wealthy and powerful.

In the Renaissance era, the printing press led to a proliferation of books and ideas, as knowledge became more widely accessible to the general public. Many famous works of literature, science, and philosophy were printed during this time, including Shakespeare's plays, Galileo's scientific treatises, and Descartes' philosophical works.

By the 18th and 19th centuries, books had become an integral part of popular culture, with novels and other works of fiction gaining widespread popularity among readers. The development of mass-market printing, which made it possible to produce large numbers of books quickly and cheaply, helped to fuel this trend.

In the 20th century, the rise of digital technology brought about new forms of publishing and distribution, including e-books and online publishing. Many traditional publishers have adapted to these changes by offering their titles in digital formats, while new digital-only publishers have emerged to take advantage of the opportunities presented by the internet and digital media.

Despite these changes, books continue to be a beloved and important medium for recording and sharing knowledge, ideas, and stories. Whether in print or digital form, books play a vital role in education, culture, and the human experience.he fall of the Roman Empire in the 5th century AD saw the decline of the culture of ancient Rome. Papyrus became difficult to obtain due to lack of contact with Egypt, and parchment, which had been used for centuries, became the main writing material. Parchment is a material made from processed animal skin and used—mainly in the past—for writing on. Parchment is most commonly made of calfskin, sheepskin, or goatskin. It was historically used for writing documents, notes, or the pages of a book. Parchment is limed, scraped and dried under tension. It is not tanned, and is thus different from leather. This makes it more suitable for writing on, but leaves it very reactive to changes in relative humidity and makes it revert to rawhide if overly wet.

Monasteries carried on the Latin writing tradition in the Western Roman Empire. Cassiodorus, in the monastery of Vivarium (established around 540), stressed the importance of copying texts.[18] St. Benedict of Nursia, in his Rule of Saint Benedict (completed around the middle of the 6th century) later also promoted reading.[19] The Rule of Saint Benedict (Ch. XLVIII), which set aside certain times for reading, greatly influenced the monastic culture of the Middle Ages and is one of the reasons why the clergy were the predominant readers of books. The tradition and style of the Roman Empire still dominated, but slowly the peculiar medieval book culture emerged.


The Codex Amiatinus anachronistically depicts the Biblical Ezra with the kind of books used in the 8th Century AD.
Before the invention and adoption of the printing press, almost all books were copied by hand, which made books expensive and comparatively rare. Smaller monasteries usually had only a few dozen books, medium-sized perhaps a few hundred. By the 9th century, larger collections held around 500 volumes and even at the end of the Middle Ages, the papal library in Avignon and Paris library of the Sorbonne held only around 2,000 volumes.[20]</article> <br><br>
