                  <p style="color:black;">Walter Isaacson tells the story of the rollercoaster life and searingly intense personality of creative entrepreneur whose passion
                  for perfection and ferocious drive revolutionized six industries: personal computers, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing, and
                  digital publishing.Although Jobs cooperated with this book, he asked for no control over what was written, nor even the right to read it before it
                  was published. He put nothing off limits. He encouraged the people he knew to speak honestly. And Jobs speaks candidly, sometimes brutally
                  so, about the people he worked with and competed against.His friends, foes, and colleagues provide an unvarnished view of the passions,
                  perfectionism, obsessions, artistry, devilry, and compulsion for control that shaped his approach to business and the innovative products that
                  resulted.</p> <br>
