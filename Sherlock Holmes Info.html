      <h2><em><u style="color:black;">About the book:-</u></em></h2>
      <p style="color:black;">Sherlock Holmes, fictional character created by the Scottish writer Arthur Conan Doyle. The prototype for the modern mastermind detective, Holmes first appeared in Conan Doyle’s A Study in Scarlet, published in Beeton’s Christmas Annual of 1887.</p>

      <h2><em><u style="color:black;">About the author:-</u></em></h2>
      <p style="color:black;">An exceptionally talented storyteller, Sir Arthur Ignatius Conan Doyle was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, in May 1859. Doyle began writing while studying at the University of Edinburgh Medical School, which he joined in 1876. Doyle graduated in 1881 and was employed as a surgeon on the steamer Mayumba on its voyage to the West African coast. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was most noted for creating the fictional detective Sherlock Holmes and writing stories about him which are generally considered milestones in the field of crime fiction. Pointing out the social injustices, Holmes offers a new and just approach in a world which is unfair. Sherlock Holmes, the most well-known fictional detective, has been listed with Guinness World Records as the “most portrayed movie character” in history.</p>

      <h2><em><u style="color:black;">Summary:-</u></em></h2>
      <summary style="color:black;">Sherlock Holmes is a private detective who has keen powers of observation. He lives at 221b Baker Street in London. He notices things that others simply don't and then he draws accurate conclusions about what he sees. In Doyle's first Holmes story, A Study in Scarlet, Holmes describes himself as someone who gets in the dumps at times and '(doesn't) open (his) mouth for days on end.' He experiences strong mood swings. He also plays the violin. But most of all, he is a master of deductive reasoning.</summary>
