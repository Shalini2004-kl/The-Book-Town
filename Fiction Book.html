                     <p style="color:black;">Paulo Coelho's masterpiece tells the mystical story of Santiago, an Andalusian shepherd boy who yearns to travel in search of a worldly treasure. His quest will lead him to riches far different—and far more satisfying—than he ever imagined. Santiago's journey teaches us about the essential wisdom of listening to our hearts, of recognizing opportunity and learning to read the omens strewn along life's path, and, most importantly, to follow our dreams.</p> <br> <br>

                      <p style="color:black;">Published in the summer of 1949, George Orwell?s nineteen Eighty-Four is one of the most definitive texts of modern literature. Set in Oceania, one of the three inter-continental superstate that divided the world among themselves after a global war, Orwell?s masterful critique of the political structures of the time, works itself out through the story of Winston Smith, a man caught in the webs of a dystopian future, and his clandestine love affair with Julia, a young woman he meets during the course of his work for the government. As much as it is an entertaining read, nineteen Eighty-Four is also a brilliant, and more importantly, a timeless satirical attack on the social and political structures of the world.</p> <br><br>

                          <p style="color:black;">Sherlock Holmes is a private detective who has keen powers of observation. He lives at 221b Baker Street in London. He notices things that others simply don't and then he draws accurate conclusions about what he sees. In Doyle's first Holmes story, A Study in Scarlet, Holmes describes himself as someone who gets in the dumps at times and '(doesn't) open (his) mouth for days on end.' He experiences strong mood swings. He also plays the violin. But most of all, he is a master of deductive reasoning.</p> <br><br>
